I'm thinking of building a ttk calculator with google sheets, python or whatever I can get my hands on.  
To calculate ttk  you'd need:  
1. *Bullet speed* 
This is not a constant as it depends on the attachments of the gun or the gun class ie sniper and marksman bullets move faster than other guns.  
2. Distance to be travelled in meters.  
3. Enemy health (hp), I'll assume it to be any of these; 100,  150, 200, 250, 300.   
4. DPS or bullet damage.  
5. Damage at range. (how the damage is distributed at specific ranges)  
6. Damage muiltiplier. (by how much the game rewards you for hitting specific body parts)
