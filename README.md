# CODM-SQL
The game Call Of Duty Mobile has extensive data, I'll write scripts in python to save the data, export it to an excel file, export the file to an SQL database and work with it from there.  
Honestly this is a lot of work since you can't scrape the data Meaning all entries will be manual.  
The are at least 96 guns in the game each with a minimum of 10* features* (for lack of a better word).  

#  The Data
It should contain the following:
  1. Gun category  
  2. Gun Name  
  3. Fire Rate  
  4. Fire interval   
  5. Base Damage  
  6. Mobility; Sprint Speed, ADS time, ADS movement speed, Reload Speed   
  7. Range  (Damage dropoff, First Damage Range, Damage spread)  
  8. Control (Horizontal and Vertical Recoil)  
  9. Accuracy(ADS bullet spread)  
All in all It should be a huge database with lots of table, primary keys n all the stuff. More documentation wto be provided later
