# CODM-SQL
The game Call Of Duty Mobile has extensive data, I'll write scripts in python to save the data, export it to an excel file, export the file to an SQL database and work with it from there.  
Honestly this is a lot of work since you can't scrape the data Meaning all entries will be manual.  
The are at least 96 guns in the game each with a minimum of 10* features* (for lack of a better word).  

#  The Data
It should contain the following:
  1. Gun category  
  2. Gun Name  
  3. Fire Rate  
  4. Fire interval   
  5. Base Damage  
  6. Mobility; Sprint Speed, ADS time, ADS movement speed, Reload Speed, sprint to fire time  
  7. Range  (Damage dropoff, First Damage Range, Damage Distribution to the body)  
  8. Control (Horizontal, Vertical Recoil and hit flinch)  
  9. Accuracy(ADS bullet spread, hipfire bullet spread, *Steady Aim countdown*)  
  10. Mag capacity  
  
 All in all It should be a huge database with lots of table, primary keys n all the stuff. More documentation wto be provided later  
 I'll try replicating the real thing as best as I can  
 
 # Why I'm doing this  
 I want to deepen my SQL knowledge, I know the basic but I want to gain some practice with hands on data, This repo will be like a playground for me.
 
 # Disclaimer  
 Call of Duty data for the guns depending on which game mode you are playing, Like for MultiPlayer the ADS bullet spread is really high as compared to Battle Royale and the damage in BR and MP greatly differ from the Zombies mode (*Base Damage in Zombies is increased*)
